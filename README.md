# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that suggests movies similar to a user's choice. The application is built with Python, using a dataset from The Movie Database (TMDB). It leverages natural language processing techniques to find similarities between movies and presents the recommendations through an interactive web interface created with Streamlit.

  \#\# üåü Features

  - **Interactive UI**: A simple and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their content similarity (genres, keywords, cast, and crew).
  - **Dynamic Poster Fetching**: Fetches and displays movie posters in real-time using the TMDB API.
  - **Vast Movie Selection**: Utilizes a rich dataset of over 4800 movies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The recommendation engine is built upon the concept of "content-based filtering". The core idea is to recommend items that are similar to those a user liked in the past. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:

      * The system uses the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**.
      * The initial data from `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` are merged.
      * Key features for recommendation are selected: `genres`, `keywords`, `overview`, `cast`, and `crew`.
      * The text data in these columns is cleaned and transformed. For instance, we extract the names of the top 3 actors from the `cast` and the director's name from the `crew`.

2.  **Feature Engineering**:

      * A "tags" corpus is created for each movie by concatenating the processed `overview`, `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew`. This consolidated string represents the movie's content profile.

3.  **Vectorization**:

      * The textual "tags" are converted into numerical vectors using the `CountVectorizer` from Scikit-learn. This technique creates a matrix where each row represents a movie and each column represents a word in the vocabulary of the entire corpus. We consider the 5000 most frequent words to keep the vector space manageable.

4.  **Similarity Calculation**:

      * The similarity between movies is calculated using the **Cosine Similarity** metric. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which indicates how similar they are, regardless of their magnitude. A similarity score close to 1 means the movies are very similar, while a score close to 0 indicates low similarity.

5.  **Recommendation**:

      * When a user selects a movie, the system finds its corresponding vector and calculates its cosine similarity with all other movies.
      * It then sorts the movies based on their similarity scores in descending order and returns the top 5 most similar movies.

## üé¨ Dataset

This project utilizes the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), which contains metadata for about 5000 movies from The Movie Database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  - **Python**
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the `CountVectorizer` and calculating `cosine_similarity`.
  - **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
  - **Pickle**: For serializing and de-serializing the trained model and data.
  - **Requests**: For making API calls to TMDB.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For model development and experimentation.

## üöÄ How to Run this Project

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset.git
    cd movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `requests`)*

3.  **Get a TMDB API Key: (for movie posters) **

      * Create an account on [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
      * Go to your account settings, find the API section, and generate an API key.
      * Replace the placeholder API key in the `fetch_poster` function in `app.py` with your own key.

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**

      * Make sure you have the `movie_list.pkl` and `similarity.pkl` files (generated from the `M_R_S.ipynb` notebook) in a `model` directory.
      * Execute the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```

5.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
